            | Dear OIS Members,
          p
            | As the term draws to an end and I reflect on the journey that we have
            | taken together as a student community, one achievement stands out above all: the
            | growing enthusiasm and participation. Over the past few months our team - 
            | Abhishek, Amit, Dev, Medha, Sadia, Shriman, Sudakshina, Ullash and Vanya -
            | has worked very hard to build on and carry forward the work of our predecessors.
            | We continued with our popular events like the Bollywood BOP, Holi
            | celebrations, as well as the 
            a(href='http://policyblog.oxfordindiasociety.org.uk') policy blog
            | which thanks to your support saw participation like never before.
        .col-sm-6.col-md-6
          p
            | We have also inaugurated events like the Indian
            | Formal Hall (held at Merton this year),  
            em Aasha
            |  - a platform to promote young artists to raise funds
            | for Indian charities, supporting innovative fundraising initiatives in
            | ingenious ways, and hosting events which facilitate interaction, be it over
            | dinner with actors like Naseeruddin Shah, seminars with the likes of
            | Christophe Jaffrelot or simply chai to discuss the election results or
            | enjoy Republic Day away from home.
          p
            | We are also putting together an elaborate plan to engage with both the new
            | and the old; the new incoming students - Indian offer-holders who will be
            | joining Oxford as well as the growing alumni body.
          p
            | As always we look towards you for support.  It is only with your greater
            | involvement and participation, the creativity and energy of new ideas that
            | we can look forward with hope to building ourselves as a student body that reflects
            | the uniqueness and diversity of the Indian student community in Oxford.
