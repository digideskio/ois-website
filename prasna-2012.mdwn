### Keynote Speeches

#### What are the specific ways in which Indo-UK relations can be strengthened in the next decade?

Prime Minister David Cameron in several recent interviews has talked of the
robustness of the Indo-UK relationship in the 21st Century. It is widely
agreed that Indo-British bilateral relations have a special historical
flavour that India does not share with any other developed nation. How this
special connection can translate (or whether it has translated) into a
dynamic modern partnership benefiting both nations is our fundamental
enquiry in this session. Through our keynote speeches we hope to chart some
specific directions in which this relationship can develop in the coming
decades. Specifically, our focus will be on ways and means to intensify
both intellectual and trade relations between the two countries;
possibilities of co-operation in international forums such as the United
Nations Security Council and international climate change conferences, and
an issue very close to our hearts – the role Oxford University can play in
deepening Indo-UK ties.

**Chair:** Prof Andrew Hamilton, Vice-Chancellor, University of Oxford.

### Session 1: Politics

#### What do the recent politics of protest in India and elsewhere imply for the principle of representation in parliamentary democracy?

2011 was a year of protest. Time magazine’s 2011 Person of the Year was The
Protester. Protests sprung up in the Arab world, occupied in the UK and the
USA and stood their ground in India. Distinct though they were in
motivation, method and demand, the protests highlighted fundamental
questions of politics and legitimacy.

A first set of questions examines the motivation for protest. Both Team
Anna and Occupy were broadly protests against ‘extractive’ institutions:
the former aimed at political extraction of bribes, the latter at economic
extraction of bonuses and bailouts. What do such existing institutions and
inegalitarian outcomes imply for a supposedly egalitarian politics of
parliamentary democracy? How do we draw implications for the legitimacy of
existing political institutions from the sight of poor, and poorly
dispersed, gains?

A second line of enquiry examines the method and demand of movements. How
do we conceive of the relationship between the methods adopted by popular
movements and politics more broadly? How do we think of ‘second-best’
legitimacy – legitimate political action when our primary political
institutions are the very object of protest? How should we evaluate the
movement’s claims to popular representation?

This session takes on political protest, looking at motivation and method
to draw lessons about the legitimacy of both existing institutions and
emerging modes of political action.

### Session 2: Sport

#### Are the BCCI's burgeoning revenues harming world cricket?

In the last two decades, the Board of Control for Cricket in India has
revolutionised the way the game is played and viewed across the world.
Having successfully capitalised on the hitherto untapped commercial
potential of cricket, sold television rights for billions of dollars, and
attracted multi-national corporate sponsors, it is little surprise that the
BCCI today is the richest cricket board in the world. From this position,
it has ensured that the effective power centre of world cricket has shifted
from the hallowed meeting rooms of the Lords’ Cricket Ground to the
corridors of India’s financial capital, Mumbai. This growing stature has
rested uneasily, not only with fellow cricketing nations, but also former
Indian players fearful of cricket itself taking a backseat, and young
cricketers unsure of whether they too will receive a share of this
ever-increasing pie.

It is in this context that this session proposes to discuss the
consequences of BCCI’s burgeoning revenues. Four lines of enquiry are
evident. First, has India, owing to its financial might, become the Big
Brother of international cricket? Has it been successful in taking other
countries along in cricket’s spectacular commercial rise or is it
alienating countries which have little to offer in return? Secondly, has
Indian domestic cricket benefited from the wealth of the BCCI? Have
infrastructure, player facilities, compensation for domestic players,
officials and umpires improved? Thirdly, has the IPL, the jewel in the
BCCI’s crown, changed the way cricket is to be played and seen henceforth?
How long can relatively less remunerative forms of the game hold their own
against money-spinners such as the IPL and 20-20 cricket generally? Is
cricket headed the football way with clubs at the centre of the
competitions, replaced by countries when the World Cup comes along?
Finally, does the internal legal structure of the BCCI need to change?
Given its immense resources and the significance of cricket in Indian
public life, is there a case for greater transparency and accountability in
the institution, with a degree of public control? Over this session, we
hope to have a critical discussion of some of these questions, questioning
the merits and demerits of the BCCI being at the helm of Indian and perhaps
world cricket today.

### Session 3: Energy Security

#### Can India's aggressive drive for nuclear energy ensure energy security in an environmentally responsible and internationally acceptable manner?

There are still nearly 300 million Indians without an electricity
connection. Although India remains heavily reliant on coal which accounts
for approximately 70% of its power generation, it has begun seriously
investing in other sources of energy. For instance, the Jawaharlal Nehru
National Solar Mission aims to provide 20,000 MW of grid connected solar
power by 2022. However, this target pales in comparison with India’s
nuclear energy generation plans – 470,000 MW over the next 40 years, with
nuclear accounting for 25% of total energy requirements by 2050, up from
the current 3%. India has set about achieving this target with
determination, signing a historic civilian nuclear energy pact with the USA
and concluding a $9 billion deal with French energy giant, Areva in
December 2010 to build reactors over the next 25 years.

This enthusiasm for nuclear energy comes however, at a time when world
opinion is distinctly wary of it especially after Japan’s horrific
Fukushima disaster. Germany has committed to shutting down all its nuclear
reactors by 2022, and even in France (which has the highest percentage
-78.8% -of nuclear-generated electricity in the world), new president
Francois Hollande has pledged to reduce nuclear dependence to 50%. Civil
society in India has also taken note of this global skepticism as the mass
protests against the Jaitapur and Kudankulam nuclear power plants attest.
In this context, there are three themes that will be in focus in this
session. First, is there a realistic non-nuclear option that will meet
India’s burgeoning energy demands, keeping in mind the increasing global
pressure on India to reduce its carbon emissions? Given the debate about
‘fracking’ in the Western world, is it worth investing in natural gas
exploration? Secondly, the session will explore the close nexus between
energy security and foreign policy, and examine what impact scaling back on
nuclear energy would have on India’s international trade relations.
Finally, the session will consider the Indian government’s handling of the
civil society protests in the context of a broader debate on the role of
technocracy and informed public participation in environmental
decision-making.

### Session 4: Economics and Welfare

#### What is the future of India as a welfare state?

Today, one of the most pressing issues faced by countries is managing debt
and spending by the state. Governments, particularly of developed
countries, are struggling to reconcile the notion of the welfare state with
the limited ability to fund such a state, particularly in the face of
towering government debt and poor prospects for economic growth.

Even as Europe and the USA reconsider their state spending priorities, it
is time for India to reflect on its own growth trajectory. India is at a
far earlier stage of economic development, and can sustain both increased
debt and higher economic growth. Yet, central and state governments face
considerable budgetary pressure in the presently conservative fiscal
framework, and are battling to contain inflation. In this environment, what
forms of spending must the government prioritise in pursuit of economic
development?

Since the introduction of liberalization in 1991, the focus of the
government on direct poverty alleviation has declined relative to reforms
and economic growth. In the last few years, the UPA government has switched
the focus back to welfare through employment guarantee programmes and the
proposed right to food. At the same time, the state is expected to promote
growth by investing in infrastructure as well as supporting the corporate
sector, particularly in manufacturing and industry.

This session will consider the key dilemmas that government faces: Should
the government continue to focus on headline growth by supporting
wealth-creation by the private sector? Should the government prioritise the
end of deprivation, particularly malnutrition, which remains stubbornly
high despite fairly widespread increases in income in the last three
decades? Where is government spending likely to be more effective?

**Chair:** Vijay Joshi, Emeritus Fellow, Merton College, University of Oxford. Professor Joshi has published widely in scholarly journals and elsewhere on International Economics and Development Economics. He has also written extensively on the economy of India, in particular two major books (jointly with I.M.D. Little), viz.

### Session 5: Media

#### Can self-regulation continue to remain a viable way forward for the Indian media?

The Indian media has been held up as an indispensable part of the nation;
where conventional checks and balances on the executive have failed, the
Indian media has often provided the sole and much-needed recourse for
public interest to express itself. A significant set of recent events,
however, have pointed to a tendency in sections of the media to
sensationalise the sensitive, adjudge persons guilty before a court of law
can reach a verdict, agree to publish ‘paid news’ and enjoy excessively
proximate relations with politicians and corporate lobbyists. This has
raised wide-ranging questions both with regard to the transparency of
Indian media and the efficacy of the existing regulatory setup. This has
come at a time when the media world in the UK too has been rocked by
controversy with the News of the World scandal pointing to deeper, systemic
concerns with the structure and regulation of the media in this country.

In this session, our panellists are invited to deliberate over two
predicaments: the norms of propriety in the media and the viability of
self-regulation in ensuring an Indian media that is fair, responsible and
democratic. On the first of these, are the media’s hysterical portrayals of
terrorist attacks, the general sensationalisation of events, its propensity
to judge undertrials as guilty before conviction, the publication of
advertisements as news articles, the running of frivolous stories as news
on several television channels, characteristic of a fervent pursuit of high
TRPs and higher profits in an inadequate regulatory environment? Or is it a
genuine response to consumer demand therefore reflecting what the Indian
television viewing audience wants to see? The second line of enquiry is
about the feasibility of allowing the media to self-regulate. The Leveson
Inquiry in the UK has been set up with the far-reaching mandate of
addressing ‘the culture, practices and ethics of the press’. What can the
media in India learn from the failings of certain media houses in England
and the ongoing Leveson inquiry? Specifically, can the Indian media be
trusted to overcome its drawbacks of sensationalisation and opacity and
emerge with an authoritative set of regulations that can be effectively
implemented, or must past experiences and the recent set of events in the
UK lead us to the conclusion that the responsibilities of regulating the
media lie in other hands? Our session will look at these pressing questions
to generate some debate and hopefully some answers as well.

### Session 6: Science and Innovation

#### Can India's search for a prudent drug policy promote Open Source Drug Discovery without the country becoming a guinea pig for clinical trials?

India has had considerable success in battling endemic diseases – while
there were an estimated 150,000 polio cases in 1985, the country was
declared polio-free by the WHO in 2012. However, the discovery of Totally
Drug-resistant Tuberculosis (TDR-TB) in India earlier this year, together
with the continued spread of endemic tropical diseases like malaria
indicate that there is still much work to be done. While scientists working
with initiatives such as India’s Open Source Drug Discovery are announcing
new chemical entities to battle TB and other infectious diseases, India has
also become a favoured destination for the clinical trial of new drugs.
India’s technically competent workforce, large patient availability, and
low costs make it an attractive destination for such trials.

These trials bring India substantial monetary gains. However, they are
offset by the frequent abuse of India's weak regulatory mechanisms for
clinical trials and drug testing. Cases of trials being carried out without
informed consent or permission being obtained for the clinical trial of one
drug while another drug is tested instead are coming to light with alarming
frequency.

On the one hand, Indian policy seems aimed at promoting cheaper drugs by
loosening the IPR regime; on the other, its population is being used as
guinea pigs for the hasty commercialisation of newly discovered drugs by
multinational companies in their drive for super profits. Given this
apparent policy disconnect, what should the role of Indian policy makers,
scientists, regulators and pharmaceutical companies be? In the years to
come, what should be India's role in the battle against diseases relevant
to the developing world?
