          <h4>Social</h4>
          <p>Although the OIS is well-known for its Bollywood bop, one of the most
  popular Oxford bops, its very first social event of the academic year
  was a Meet-n-Greet that brought together new and old Indian students
  at Oxford under one roof. The society's social engagements also extend
  to topical events like the Republic Day celebration.</p>

          <h4>Cultural</h4>
          <p>In order to showcase the cultural diversity of India to the Oxford
  community, the OIS threw a successful Holi party, organised an Indian
  formal dinner -- the first of many to come, and had Bollywood actors
  Naseeruddin Shah and Ratna Pathak regale the audience with a poetry
  reading. OIS members also exhibited
  their culinary and dance skills at the annual International Festival,
  alongside our neighbours -- the Pakistan and Bangladesh societies.

          <h4>Fundraising</h4>
          <p>As part of its commitment to charitable causes, the OIS routinely
  organises and participates in events to raise money for its partner
  institutions. This year we contributed to the Bhopal Medical Appeal
  through the Oxford Town &amp; Gown charity race, as well as fundraising
  for the Act for Change India.

      <div class="col-sm-6 col-md-3 category" id="seminar-show">
          <h4>Seminars</h4>
          <p>One of the three founding principles of the OIS is to promote
  contemporary intellectual thought. To that end, the society invited
  leading names from the fields of human rights, law, politics to interact with the Oxford community via talks and seminars.
