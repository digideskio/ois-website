Established in 2003, the Oxford Indian Society (OIS) was formed to celebrate the diverse culture of India. The OIS has since developed into a large and active student-run organization. As a society, we strongly believe in the idea of “Vasudhaiv Kutumbakam”, or global oneness. As such, our members include Indian students, students of Indian origin, as well as a significant number of non-Indians who wish to celebrate Indian culture and are interested in the current political, economic, and social issues relevant to India today. Our activities are centred on promoting Indian culture (music, food, festivals) and contemporary intellectual thought through organising a range of talks, debates and seminars. We also hold joint events with other Oxford societies, and regularly use our events to raise funds for charitable institutions including “Asha for Education”, “Bhopal Medical Appeal”, “GiveIndia” and “Jamghat”. Our commitment to the charitable cause will always remain one of the driving forces behind our activities.

<h3>Hem Borker</h3></a><h4>President</h4>
<p>Hem is a Clarendon Scholar doing her DPhil in Education. Her academic interests centre around exploring the manner in which categories such as religion, gender, caste, class, community fuse to shape everyday educational choices. Outside her Department and SSL, Hem can be found enjoying a run in the University Parks or procrastinating while cooking in the kitchen. As this years’ President, Hem is keen that the activities of the OIS represent the uniqueness and diversity of the Indian student community in Oxford. She is particularly interested that the OIS provides a platform for interface and engagement between current Indian students, alumni, international students interested in India amongst themselves and with eminent indians from varying fields ranging across politics, sports, development sector, media, performing arts.</p>
