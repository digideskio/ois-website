Dear friends,

It is our pleasure to welcome you to yet another exciting year at Oxford. The last year for Oxford India Society was a period full of accomplishments, where our dedicated volunteers brought to you some of the best cultural, sports and intellectual events, from the famous Bollywood BOP to nuanced discussions on the Indian Elections to our friendly cricket match with Pakistan. 

This year, we aim to take this momentum forward, and mark a bold new beginning of OIS. We aim to be not only a central hub for all things Indian at Oxford, but also an important stakeholder in connecting the voices of our brilliant community to the nation building activities back home. Indians at home and abroad have entered an enthusiastic phase full of hope and optimism and I have met many of you who have said how much they would like to channel their passion and education into doing something good for their country. So, here is a theme that I propose which will run central to all our activities this year: Oxford for India.

Along with all the exciting, inspiring and fun things OIS has brought to you last year, this year we want to bring the "action" element in the things we do. So we would coordinate with the deep and diverse resources at the University of Oxford and develop groups and forums that you can join, to meet and work with people who share your interests and can come together to build something actionable. 

For making Oxford for India a reality, we would need your support and enthusiasm in helping us help you bring about real change in true Oxford spirit!

Regards,
Anjul Khadria
President, Oxford India Society
