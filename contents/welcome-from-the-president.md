Dear friends,

It gives us immense pleasure to welcome all of you to yet another exciting year at Oxford. The last year for Oxford India Society was a stellar one with a period full of initiatives and endeavors – Welcome event, Diwali Dinner, Holi, Bollywood BOPs, Republic Day event, IndoPak cricket match and the list goes on… our volunteers and committee members brought to you a range of cultural, sports and intellectual events.
This year we plan to continue the good practices and build on the momentum gained over the last few years. With a highly diverse committee at charge, we aim to be not only a central hub for all ‘Indian’ things at Oxford but also a vibrant source of energy in driving the ‘real’ change across the University. Indians at home and abroad have entered an enthusiastic phase full of hope, anxiety and optimism. We have met many of you who have expressed their willingness to channel their passion and education into doing something ‘good’ for the Oxford University and India at large. We live strong to our theme that runs central to all our activities: Oxford for India.
We pledge to inspire all of you by bringing the "action" element in all the things we do. For that, we will synergize the strength of collaboration in this highly intellectual place by coordinating with deep and diverse resources available here. The idea is to develop groups and forums that you can join, to meet and work with people who share your interests and to come together to build something actionable.
We look forward to your unbiased support and undying enthusiasm in order to bring about a camaraderie in the spirit of India (and its students) in this lovely town of Oxford!

Ankit Shah
Interim President (Elected Secretary), Oxford India Society
