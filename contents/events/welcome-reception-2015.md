We are glad to invite you to the formal welcome reception for the incoming Indian students at the University of Oxford at Sheldonian Theatre on 20th October, 5:30 pm. We will be joined by Prof. Andrew Hamilton, Honourable Vice Chancellor of the University of Oxford & His Excellency Dr. Virander Paul, Deputy High Commissioner of the Republic of India to the UK.

If you are a fresher (matriculating in 2015) then please register through this form: https://goo.gl/NxBfld

If you are a returning student or a staff then please register through this form: https://goo.gl/sJJocN

Please note that it is important for you to register in order to attend this event. Since the venue can accommodate only limited number of people so in case we have surplus of registrations, preference will be given to the freshers. Also, we will not be able to allow any guests due to limited seats. 

We hope to see you there! Jai Hind!
