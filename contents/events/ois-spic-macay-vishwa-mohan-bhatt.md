The Oxford India Society organised a musical concert by Pandit Vishwa Mohan
Bhatt, Grammy Award winner and creator of the Mohan Veena; in collaboration
with SPIC MACAY, and sponsored by the [Nehru
Centre](http://www.nehrucentre.org.uk/). Creator of the Mohan Veena and the
winner of the Grammy Award, Vishwa Mohan Bhatt has mesmerised the world with
his music.

A disciple of Pt. Ravi Shankar, Vishwa Mohan Bhatt has attracted international
attention by his successful indianisation of the western Hawaiian guitar with
his perfect assimilation of sitar, sarod & veena techniques, by giving it a
evolutionary design & shape and by adding 14 more strings helping him to
establish the instrument Mohan Veena  to unbelievable heights. 

He was accompanied on the Tabla by Raj Kumar Mishra.
