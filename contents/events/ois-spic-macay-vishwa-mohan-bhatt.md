Oxford India Society played host to Grammy Award winner
Pandit Vishwa Mohan Bhatt on Wednesday, 5th November at a musical concert which
saw a turnout of over 100 students.
 
A disciple of internationally acclaimed Sitar maestro, Pandit Ravi Shankar,
Vishwa Mohan Bhatt is world renowned for inventing the Mohan Veena. The Mohan
Veena is an original Indian adaptation of the Hawaiian guitar, featuring
fourteen additional strings, enabling him to incorporate playing styles from
other Indian instruments such as the sitar, sarod and veena.
 
At the iconic Hollywell Music Room, which ranks as one of the oldest music
halls in Europe, Pandit Vishwa Mohan Bhatt accompanied by Pandit Rajkumar
Mishra on the table gave a mesmerizing performance. This included his Grammy
award winning composition ‘A Meeting by the River’. Pandit Vishwa Mohan Bhatt
played several ragas such as *Raga Vishwa Ranjini*, educating the audience about
the nuances of the classical Indian music. He demonstrated the different *talas*
at varying speeds exhibiting the intricacies that went into playing of the
instrument. The audience sang along with the maestro and each rendition was received with thundering applause.
The performance culminated with a Q&A session where
Pandit Vishwa Mohan Bhatt answered a range of questions about how he invented
the Mohan Veena and how it compares to classical Indian and Western instruments.
On popular request he played the Indian national song *Vande Mataram* amidst
cheers from the audience. The night culminated with a standing ovation for the
maestro and a vote of thanks to the Nehru Centre, Spic Macay and Oxford India
Society for making the event possible.
