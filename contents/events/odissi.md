So join us on this journey where we reinterpret themes of freedom and happiness through four glorious dance forms: Mohiniyattam, Kathak, Bharatnatyam, and Odissi.

The festival will feature India's most renowned dancer and choreographer, Padma Shri Guru Ileana Citaristi followed by a troupe of young elegant artistes.
