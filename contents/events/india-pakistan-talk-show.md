On the Front with Kamran Shahid
(An episode for the leading Pakistani news channel, Duniya TV)


How do we perceive India versus Pakistan?
Have we fought enough or do we still have resources to waste on this two-sided war?
Is it possible for the two nuclear power nations to provide food and education to every child of the two countries? 
Is an India-Pakistan cricket match just a game or a small-time war?
What does the road to peace look like?
Can we bring back the world-leading legacy of Taxila-Nalanda?
What should be our role in constructing a bridge between the two nations?
Can we make the subcontinent as successful as the European Union? 

Come and take part in this exciting discussion between Indian and Pakistani students at the University of Oxford, moderated by Kamran Shahid on his famous show, ‘On the Front with Kamran Shahid’ to be aired on Duniya TV (leading Urdu language news and current affairs television channel in Pakistan).
