OIS's first charity dinner at the Corpus Christi College dining hall, the
proceeds of which went to Act for Change, an initiative to spread mental
health awareness in India through forum theatre. The dinner and desserts,
made by the OIS masterchefs, were accompanied by a magic show and musical
performance, as well as a play that served as a taster for the charity's
campaign. With well over 80 people in attendance, OIS' first independently
organised fundraiser was a success and the first of many to come.
