<h2> President </h2>

<img src="http://data.oxfordindiasociety.org.uk/thumbnails/1.President_Maruthi.jpg" style="width:100px;height:100px;"> 

<a href = "mailto:maruthi.malladi@univ.ox.ac.uk"> Maruthi Malladi </a>
Maruthi is a 3rd year undergraduate studying Engineering Sciences. I am specializing into mechanical engineering. I was born in Hyderabad and has grown up partially in India and the UK. I am amateur Carnatic vocalist and violinist. I would like to see the Oxford India Society act as a platform for all Indians to share experiences and discussions on current affairs.
 I have been involved with the OIS for over a year. I have worked as an events officer and helped out the committee. I feel that this experience is worth having to take up a position as the president of OIS into the next academic year. I have worked on multiple other committees such as the Engineers Without Borders, Engineering Society and the college JCR. These have taught me to be organized, manage time, responsible and see any task taken up to the end. I feel that I have these qualities making me a good candidate for president.

<a href = "mailto:sneha.menon@seh.ox.ac.uk">Sneha Menon </a>
I am a graduate student of economics, at Teddy Hall, from Bombay.  My professional background is in the socio-economic policy research and my academic background is in math and statistics. Along with the seminars and social events already characteristic of the OIS, the few initiatives that I would be interested in facilitating, are
1.	A space for informal discussions, reading groups etc.
2.	An active blog/magazine/writ forum
3.	Movie screenings and gigs (showcasing some of the Indian independent scene maybe)
4.	Avenues to volunteer/collaborate with grass root organizations in India
And of course if elected, I would first like to conduct a survey (what else can you expect from a social scientist right), to understand the OIS community and their expectations better, and also to crowdsource cool ideas. I have some experience with leading student organizations, and I usually work without much hierarchy and with lots of collaboration. 
I imagine, that most of you like me see a greater purpose to our Oxford stints, over and above the length of the bibliography we manage to generate and I am contesting to be President, because I would like the OIS to be a small channel for this purpose. Thanks! 
PS: Please feel free to email me (sneha.menon@seh.ox.ac.uk) with any questions/suggestions that you may have!

<h2>Secretary</h2>

<img src="http://data.oxfordindiasociety.org.uk/thumbnails/2.Secretary_Niyati.jpg" style="width:100px;height:130px;"> 


<a href = "mailto:niyati.gupta@st-annes.ox.ac.uk">Niyati Gupta</a>
Being a 1+1 MBA candidate has afforded me the opportunity to live the Oxford experience for two years instead of one. I am currently reading for my MSc. in Education (Learning and Technology) to be followed by the MBA programme starting September 2016. I hold an undergraduate in Business Administration after which I worked in education consulting and leadership development across public sector schools in rural India. Following this I co-founded a tech-startup to develop educational products for low income private schools. 
Working in the capacity of the OIS Secretary would allow me to not only help continue OIS initiatives like the speaker series events, debates, movie screenings and cultural events like Holi and music concerts but also introduce new once. Some ideas we can explore are: starting an annual Oxford India Conference to start cross disciplinary conversations and collaboration across sectors (perfect timing - the 70th Independence Day of India!); creating wider outreach for the OIS within the Oxford community and a stronger alumni network to foster relationships; and an “Experience India weekend”. If given this opportunity, I hope to represent the interest of all OIS members to the best of my abilities both within and outside the Oxford sphere.


<img src="http://data.oxfordindiasociety.org.uk/thumbnails/2.Secretary_Sparshita.jpg"  style="width:100px;height:130px;"> 


<a href = "mailto:sparshita.dey@sjc.ox.ac.uk">Sparshita Dey </a>
The main reason for my interest in the OIS is to increase awareness of Indian culture through visual experiences of its characteristic features such as Classical Art forms, and various other aspects of the Indian cultural experience. I particularly feel that there is more scope of facilitating better interaction between the undergraduate and graduate communities with the same interests – namely HumSoc and OIS itself, and feel that bridging this gap may open many more opportunities including involvement in large-scale national events such as Battle of Bollywood – something I believe I can make happen being a First Year Physics Undergraduate at St. John’s. Currently I am choreographing for the Kathak aspect of the Odissi Dance fest, and wish to see many more such events being organized; being a part of OIS will, in my opinion allow a greater scope to popularize such events within Oxford. I have also had previous experience in similar, more subject related roles at school such as starting up a theoretical physics society from scratch, which was quite successful, as well as having an understanding in the requirements of the smooth running and planning of large scale events, having performed/been involved myself in various occasions. I think that I can apply similar techniques to successfully promote and further popularize the OIS.

<h2>Treasurer</h2>


<img src="http://data.oxfordindiasociety.org.uk/thumbnails/3.Treasurer_Sachi.jpg" style="width:100px;height:100px;">


<a href = "mailto:sunit.patel@ox.ac.uk">Sachi Patel</a>
Sachi Patel is a 3rd year DPhil student exploring the relationship between politics and religion in India during the 15th -17th century in Northern India. Sachi has a great passion for Indian history, Sanskrit and contemporary matters concerning India. Sachi’s passions concerning India however are not restricted to academic research, he has also actively contributed toward the success of a variety of celebrated Indian public welfare projects, including a midday meals programme to feed 300,000 young school children daily in Mumbai, a visionary eco-village project promoting holistic well-being and sustainable living in India. He is currently involved in an international educational app based initiative that will raise funds for these projects and others in India.  Recently, he has also been a key organizer for a UK fund raising event for the Sharan Project, which supports abused women from South Asian Backgrounds.  He has been a member of the Oxford India Society for a number of years, keenly attending many events and is enthusiastic to get more involved to help it grow. If you would like to connect further or have any questions, please feel free to drop an email at sunit.patel@ox.ac.uk.

<a href = "mailto:utsav.popat@balliol.ox.ac.uk">Utsav Popat </a>
My name is Utsav Popat and I study Mathematics and Computer Science at Balliol College. I believe that I have the requisite experience to serve effectively as the Treasurer of our Society - having served as the Treasurer of OUSU's International Students' Campaign. Hence, apart from having knowledge of the financial side of an International Society at Oxford, I am well versed with the formats and the requirements of the paperwork required by Proctors - a key role for the post. Furthermore, I am a part of the Publicity and Funding Committee of Oxford Nightline. I work with a team to find new avenues of funding for the organisation and achieving more interaction from the general student body. If elected as Treasurer, I firmly believe that these experiences will hold me in good stead and aid me in living up to the expectations - if not exceed them - that come with this position.

<h2>Events Manager</h2>

<img src="http://data.oxfordindiasociety.org.uk/thumbnails/4.Events Manager_Siddharth.jpg" style="width:100px;height:100px;">


<a href = "mailto:siddharth.jayaprakash@lmh.ox.ac.uk">Siddharth Jayaprakash </a>
My name is Siddharth Jayaprakash and I'm currently doing a Bachelor of Arts in Jurisprudence (Law) at Lady Margaret Hall, Oxford. I was previously based in Bangalore but have done a large part of my schooling in the Middle East. I am very interested in doing some work for the OIS and my status as an undergraduate would mean I have relatively more time to invest. I'm applying for the positions of Events Manager and External Relations Manager. Both these offices seem to have plenty of event managing involved and I have a lot of experience in that particular sector. At present I am Under-Secretary General for the Oxford UN Association and am organizing an international MUN for them this coming Michaelmas. The position requires me to book locations in various colleges of the University, cater to the needs of 500 delegates from universities across the world and manage communications both with the delegates and officials from their universities. I am confident I can perform a similar function for the OIS as well.

I am present in the first year of my DPhil. in International Development at St. Antony’s College and the present Vice-President of Welfare in the College GCR. I’m closely involved with the Oxford Odissi Centre and presently working as a Secretary for the Centre. From Michelmas 2016 to Hilary 2017, I will be conducting fieldwork in India which gives me a platform to connect with organizations in India and for coordinating with agencies that will be contributing to OIS, such as getting in touch with speakers based in India, or approaching institutions that can be potential partners of OIS. Once back to Oxford, I wish to host Speaker events in 2017 - celebrating 70 years of Indian Independence. 

<h2>Sports Manager</h2>

My name is Soham Bandyopadhyay, and I am about to start my 3rd year of Medical School at St Hilda's College. I would like to be Sports Manager to oversee the possibility of creating a cricket and badminton tournament between different universities and colleges, involving individuals who are part of ALL Asian societies. I would also like to actively engage Indian Society in the creation of an Oxford University Kabaddi team

<a href = "mailto:utsav.popat@balliol.ox.ac.uk"> Utsav Popat </a>
My name is Utsav Popat and I study Mathematics and Computer Science at Balliol College. This means that while I share a love-hate relationship with my computer, we usually sort out our differences before a problem sheet is due (albeit after much coaxing and promises of lavish gifts on my behalf). Apart from this 'connection' with my computer, I also have experience in the field of IT Support. I provided Tech Support as an intern at a stock broking firm - writing scripts/macros to help with daily tasks, maintaining and modifying the company's website, and aiding in the establishment of a new IT infrastructure in the organization. If elected, I will focus on working with the other IT officer to ensure that the mailing list does not encounter any more errors so that we can welcome the new students in a hassle free manner, come Michelmas.
