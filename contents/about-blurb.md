Established in 2003, the Oxford Indian Society (OIS) was formed to
celebrate the diverse culture of India. The OIS has since developed into a
large and active student-run organization. As a society, we strongly
believe in the idea of “Vasudhaiv Kutumbakam”, or global oneness. As such,
our members include Indian students, students of Indian origin, as well as
a significant number of non-Indians who wish to celebrate Indian culture
and are interested in the current political, economic, and social issues
relevant to India today. Our activities are centred on promoting Indian
culture (music, food, festivals) and contemporary intellectual thought
through organising a range of talks, debates and seminars. We also hold
joint events with other Oxford societies, and regularly use our events to
raise funds for charitable institutions including “Asha for Education”,
“Bhopal Medical Appeal”, “GiveIndia” and “Jamghat”. Our commitment to the
charitable cause will always remain one of the driving forces behind our
activities.
