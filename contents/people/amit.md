I am a second year D.Phil candidate in Inorganic Chemistry. As a cultural
secretary of Oxford India Society my role is to assist the committee in
organizing social (meet and greet, Bollywood BOPs, Movie nights) and
cultural (Holi, Diwali) events. I am always open to your ideas and
concerns. Feel free to get in touch if you have any queries or suggestions!
