Utsav is a 2nd Year undergraduate reading Mathematics and Computer Science at Balliol College. Translation: He shares a love-hate relationship with his laptop most of the time, though he does resolve differences right before a problem sheet is due. He manages the OIS website and hence, can often be seen coaxing the code to work. If you have any queries, suggestions or bugs (please no!), then please email him.
