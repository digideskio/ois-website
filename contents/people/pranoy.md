Pranoy is reading for a DPhil in Engineering Science at Oxford. He clambers his way through the second year attempting to make some sense of the turbulence in jet engines (Ordo Ab Chao). A mechanical engineer by heart, he is a strong proponent of the intrinsically Indian technique of Jugaad.
Born in Bhubaneswar, he is an Odia (not to be confused with Bengali). And that is where he has completed his Bachelors in Technology before moving onto the
Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore for his Masters. He is an avid actor and anticipates being the next big thing in Bollywood after Tusshar Kapoor.
