Paritosh is a MSc student in Computer Science. I am from Delhi and great lover of food and computer games. 
I believe in enjoying life as it comes. A dialogue which I find funny and true is “Degree se sirf certificate milta hai, akal nahin” – Raju Ban Gaya Gentleman. That's pretty much all about me.  
If you have any trouble, you can contact me at paritosh.mittal@cs.ox.ac.uk.
