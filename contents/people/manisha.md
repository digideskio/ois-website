Manisha is currently a 4th Year DPhil student in the Department of Biochemistry and works on cell biology. She is the Publicity Director with OIS this year. She is an experimentalist at heart, at work and in life, and loves taking challenges head on. When not in the lab, she likes to spend her time in the company of her friends, exploring the varied food scene in Oxford. She is an ardent fan of anything that relates to India, especially Bollywood, and can be seen shaking a leg or two at the BOPs despite her two left feet. She thoroughly enjoys a good discussion; be it politics or current affairs, and is always up for a good debate. She looks forward to providing a platform for everyone to be able to enjoy and celebrate Indian Culture!
