Nikhil comes to Oxford with over 6 years of experience in the solar industry. Having work with rural markets in India and East Africa, he is extremely passionate about delivering sustainable energy services to such markets. Nikhil's interests range from humming songs of Indian Ocean to engaging with anything connected with Bollywood; from politics to doing business in India. He is on a constant lookout for a place that serves chaat at Oxford, which is his only complaint -- chaat is a mouthwatering Indian snack, impossible to find at Oxford!.

He is currently an MBA student & Skoll Scholar at Sa√Ød Business School.
