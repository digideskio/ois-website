Abhishek is actually an android who is interested in how humans interact
with technology, using it to improve their lives and make sense of the
world around us. In spare time, Abhishek also takes care of the MCR website
and plays table tennis. Previously Abhishek studied physics, but has
acknowledged that his nature is better suited to understanding the world
using computer science, which Abhishek is happily doing as part of a DPhil.
