Dhruti came to Oxford in 2012 in order to pursue an MSc in Clinical Embryology with the help of the Diamond Jubilee Scholarship by the British Council. She couldn't get enough of Oxford during the one year Masters course and decided to stay back for a DPhil in Obstetrics and Gynaecology, generously funded by the Clarendon scholarship. Her research focuses on increasing the chance of a genetically healthy pregnancy via assisted reproductive techniques. When she is not busy marveling at the beauty and complexity of human genetics, she likes to spend her time experimenting with cooking, travelling and debating about anything under the sun. As the Secretary, she will strive to make Oxford India Society a platform to enhance discussion of thriving issues and make it more engaging in every aspect. If you would like to share any ideas or suggestions, please feel free to drop an email at dhruti.babariya [@] chch.ox.ac.uk.
