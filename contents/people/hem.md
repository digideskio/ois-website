Hem is a Clarendon Scholar doing her DPhil in Education. Her academic
interests centre around exploring the manner in which categories such as
religion, gender, caste, class, community fuse to shape everyday
educational choices. Outside her Department and SSL, Hem can be found
enjoying a run in the University Parks or procrastinating while cooking in
the kitchen. As this yearsâ€™ President, Hem is keen that the activities of
the OIS represent the uniqueness and diversity of the Indian student
community in Oxford. She is particularly interested that the OIS provides a
platform for interface and engagement between current Indian students,
alumni, international students interested in India amongst themselves and
with eminent indians from varying fields ranging across politics, sports,
development sector, media, performing arts. She can be reached at
