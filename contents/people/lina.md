I am a Clarendon scholar and an MSc candidate in Contemporary India. Hailing from South Korea, I was educated in New Delhi for 7 years and obtained a BA in French with Honours from Jawaharlal Nehru University. During my undergraduate degree in JNU, I served as Vice-President of International Students Association. At Oxford, I am happy to be External Relations officer to share my favourite Indian culture, food, festivals and Bollywood movies with my Oxford colleagues!
