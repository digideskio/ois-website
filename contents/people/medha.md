I have completed my undergrad from National Law Institute University,
Bhopal, India and worked with a Supreme Court Judge for a year thereafter.
I am interested in understanding the interaction between law and social
change. I have worked extensively on constitutional and social issues in
the law such as gender justice and criminal laws, as well as environmental
law. I enjoy writing and reading about the aforementioned issues and look
forward to spreading awareness about the same.
