Arvind joined the University of Oxford in April 2014 as a Postdoctoral Scientist at the Weatherall Institute of Molecular Medicine, JR Hospital. Prior to oxford, he obtained his Ph.D. in Drug Delivery from School of Pharmacy, Queenâ€™s University Belfast, UK. Before moving to the UK, Arvind had the opportunity to pursue science in various parts of India giving dimensions to his understanding towards the cultural diversity spread around. 
Throughout academics, he has been involved in various cultural societies and activities in India as well as in the UK. In Belfast he had the opportunity to meet people coming from around the world giving him the opportunity to learn about various cultures; and he has always enjoyed these multicultural interactions. There, he also had the opportunity to represent the vibrant and rich South Asian culture to this part of the western world. Arvind is looking forward to enjoying this academic year with the Oxford India Society, celebrating Indian culture and spreading smiles all around.
