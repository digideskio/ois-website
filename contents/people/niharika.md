As the Treasurer for OIS, I maintain all the financial records. It is my duty to ensure that as a society we spend only on things that would benefit a majority of our members. 
With a BTech degree in Aerospace Engineering from IIT Madras, I am currently doing a DPhil in Engineering Science. When I am not trying to make aircrafts more efficient, I can be found sitting in the last row of any seminar or lecture hoping to learn about India. When you have a chat with me do look out for some veiled Harry Potter references.
