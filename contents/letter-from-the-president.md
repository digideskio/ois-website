Dear friends,

As the year draws to a close and I reflect on the journey that we have taken
together as a student community, one achievement stands out above all: the
growing enthusiasm and participation. Over the past year our team worked very
hard to promote the reputation of Oxford India Society as a student body that
represents the uniqueness and diversity of India in Oxford. For this I would
like to thank our team -Abhishek, Amit, Devendra, Medha, Sadia, Shriman,
Sudakshina, Ullash and Vanya- and everyone who volunteered in helping the
committee to deliver a packed OIS calendar with over 24 quality events.

Thanks to your support we were able to host a wide array of events ranging from
social events like the Bollywood BOP, Holi celebrations, screening of election
results to cultural events like the Vishwa Mohan Bhatt Musical Concert, poetry
reading by Naseeruddin Shah to seminars with the likes of Christophe Jaffrelot,
P Sainath and Soli Sorabjee. Your encouragement enabled our committee to
introduce events like the Indian Formal Hall (held at Merton this year),
initiate Aasha - a platform to promote young artists to raise funds for Indian
charities and get the student community involved in fundraising for India in
ingenious ways such as the Diwali Dinner at Corpus Christi where we helped
raise close to £ 3000.

This year we also tried to spread greater awareness of the Oxford India Society
and Oxford University by engaging with the incoming Indian offer holders, the
ever-growing strong alumni network, an effort (much to our pride) that was
acknowledged and appreciated by the University. With the generous support of
our student community we have instituted the Oxford India Society Award, which
provides a platform for Oxford students to critically engage with Policy
questions and reinforces our commitment to the [Oxford India Policy blog](http://policyblog.oxfordindiasociety.org.uk).

The culmination of elections for the coming year, also brings my personal
journey as the OIS President to an end. I think for me the last year with OIS
has been one of the most humbling, exciting and rewarding (and some times
stressful) experiences of my life. I couldn’t have asked for a better platform
to ‘do something’ and the fact that I met some great people and made greater
friends along the way makes this so much more memorable.

I hope that you would continue to support the OIS. The incoming committee has
some excellent ideas and I would urge all of you to participate and get
involved in the society and its events. On behalf of the outgoing committee I
wish the new President Anjul and his team – Arghya, Arvind, Ashish, Amba ,
Dhruti, Devendra, Madhav, Mandvi , Niharika, Nikhil, Pranoy, Ritesh,  Shifali ,
Sounak , Varshita and Vishal the very best for 2015.

OIS President 2014
