The University of Oxford has educated Indians since 1871. Since then, some of the most famous Indians, including two of India's Prime Ministers, Indira Gandhi and Dr. Manmohan Singh, have studied at Oxford. Moreover, Indians to have held academic posts include former President of India, Dr. Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan, Nobel Laureate Amartya Sen and India's Chief Scientific Advisor and Bharat Ratna recipient Prof. C.N.R. Rao. Today, Indians at Oxford are a thriving community, and Oxford India Society was established in 2003 to bring the community together and celebrate its diverse culture. OIS has since developed into a large and active student-run organization.

Our Values
-------------

As a society, we strongly believe in the idea of "Vasudhaiv Kutumbakam", or global oneness. As such, our members include Indian students, students of Indian origin, as well as a significant number of non-Indians who wish to celebrate Indian culture and are interested in the current political, economic, and social issues relevant to India today.


Our Activities
-------------

Our activities are centred on promoting Indian culture (music, food, festivals) and contemporary intellectual thought through organising a range of talks, debates and seminars. We also hold joint events with other Oxford societies, and regularly use our events to raise funds for charitable institutions including "Asha for Education", "Bhopal Medical Appeal", "Give India" and "Jamghat". Our commitment to the charitable cause will always remain one of the driving forces behind our activities.


Our Logo
-------------

The Oxford India Society logo is inspired by the same elegant timelessness found in all things associated with University of Oxford, including the square blue logos of the university and departments. The logo is draped in Oxford Blue, and features the Ashok Chakra pillared atop the tricolour OIS at the centre. OIS has a mission to be the bridge between Oxford and India, which is symbolised by the silhouette of the Taj Mahal and Oxford skyline in the logo. The logo was conceived and designed by Anjul Khadria (DPhil student at Department of Chemistry; President of OIS 2015) and Prateek Raj (PhD student at University College London (UCL) School of Management).
