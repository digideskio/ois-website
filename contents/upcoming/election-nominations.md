The Oxford India Society will have its annual elections in Michaelmas Term
to select the new committee for 2015. Being a part of the committee is a
great opportunity to organise events, network, engage with charities,
organise fun events like the Bollywood Bop; and discover new ways to
represent the uniquely diverse community of Indian students in Oxford.

We are calling for nominations for the positions of President, Secretary
and Treasurer and also for the following teams (we are ideally looking for
3 people per team): Systems, Contact, Events, Publicity.

People can nominate themselves for multiple teams, see
<http://elections.oxfordindiasociety.org.uk/> for what each team does.

The deadline for receiving nominations is Sat Nov 15 2359 GMT 2014
All nominations should be sent to <elections@oxfordindiasociety.org.uk>.
